--Notes for what needs to be done--

--The driver module: Need control of elevator using go-esque techniques

The behaviour of oue slave: 
It should take an order from the optimization algorithm and take the elevator to the desired floor. When the elevator has arrived it should alert its master. 

If the elevator is going up and have an order from the command panel, this should be prioritized.If the command order is in the other way of the current direction and the elevator gets an external order which is in the same direction as the current direction this order should be prioritized. We have this, since we assume that there is no evil passengers saying that they want up, then ordering a lower floor.

The module should control all lights and keep the door open for three seconds if its to stop on a floor. It should also tell its master about new orders and current floor and direction (only telling when there's a change, so this doesnt get spammed. Need to use channels smartly here, I think) 


Think we need some channel use for the checking of elevator sensors and buttons, cant check all the time. 

--The network module:

Yngve: Should we have a format on the messages sent in the form of that the first sign in the message specifies what type of message it is?

If multiple slaves says "I'm master" at the same time, how do we decide which will be master? 
If one elevator detects multiple new elevators, where 1 is saying "I'm master", then it should assume that its connected to an already established group and subdue to its master. 


--The order optimalization module: Is this going to adapt itself to a bigger number of elevators? I reckon yes!





We also need to find out the interfaces between the different modules. Expect tons of work the next two weeks.
